# PyTorchLabeling

This project focuses on developing a labeled image dataset containing at least 300 images. Each image is paired with a label file that specifies the coordinates and names of various object classes, such as persons, traffic signs, and building addresses.


The project allows for the use of any programming tools for the labeling process, and unique labeling methods are encouraged for a higher evaluation. The dataset is designed to be compatible with PyTorch, ensuring seamless integration into machine learning workflows.


Additionally, the project includes an object classification implementation using PyTorch's TorchVision library, utilizing pre-trained models like AlexNet, Inception v3, DenseNet121, ResNet101, and ResNet50 to enhance classification performance.


The ultimate goal is to create a robust and functional dataset that supports object detection and classification tasks in the field of computer vision.
